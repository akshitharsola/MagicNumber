# MagicNumber
In this project I used HTML, CSS and Python. In python I used a small topic called Magic Number. Using HTML I hosted my python project using pyscript. Even CSS was used for better designing of the page. Now what is Magic Number ? A 3 digit input without repetition of the number always gives the result 1089 by first reversing the input and subtracting it with the input. Then the obtained output is reversed and then both are added. This result gives 1089. Till Github I only used two technologies that is HTML & CSS and Python. But when the hosting on AWS will be completed three frameworks will be working together and a mini project will be developed.
